# Tic-Tac-Qute
#QtFramework, QT, QtNetwork, QtWidgets
Tic-Tac-Toe project i've created using the QT framework.
It was compiled using the Desktop Qt 5.7.0 MinGW 32bit.
It was poorly commented - for what i'm sorry - but still, it is one of my first projects using the Qt and the first project to be posted on GitHub.
I do realize that the project may be poorly codded too, so if you see any mistakes or have some other questions or else - feel free to comment \ post edits and your messages. Thank you!

/I also added an .exe file to the project, so if you're willing to simply test it out - all needed files are included!/

*Description:*

-The project is using network interface;

-The port that is beign binded is 55555 - so mind if your network hardware allows you to connect on that port (e.g if it's opened and whether it's accessible)

-If your network doesn't allow you to use that port, you can still run two examples of the program on your local machine and simply connect to your localhost (that's the way i tested it out)
