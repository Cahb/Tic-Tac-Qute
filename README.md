# Tic-Tac-Qute
Tic-Tac-Toe project i've created using the QT framework
It was compiled using the Desktop Qt 5.7.0 MinGW 32bit
It was poorly commented - for what i'm sorry - but still, it is one of my first projects using the Qt and the first project to be posted on GitHub.
I do realize that the project may be poorly codded too, so if you see any mistakes or have some other questions or else - feel free to comment \ post 
edits and your messages. Thank you!
